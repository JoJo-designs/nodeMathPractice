# Node Math Practice

Basic math is an important life skill and with most people having access to a calculator at a moments notices the skill is become harder to foster and keep sharp. That is why I am building this node practice app. This simple program that will allow users to practice basic math like multiplication. 

## Usage

Simple to use clone the repo and use npm install inside the folder. start the program with node index.js.

## Current

In the apps current state users can only practice multiplication with the max being 12x12. 

## future

I plan on building subtraction, addition, and division.
