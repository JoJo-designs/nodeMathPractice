# Node Math Practice

Basic math is an important life skill and with most people having access to a calculator at a moments notices the skill is become harder to foster and keep sharp. That is why I am building this node practice app. This simple program that will allow users to practice basic math like multiplication. 

## Usage

Simple to use clone the repo and use npm install inside the folder. start the program with node index.js.

## Current

In the apps current state users can practice multiplication up to 12x12 and addition with the highest individual number being 90. 

## future

I plan on building subtraction and division. I think I may build a proper front end so it is more user friendly.
